# Project: Flower Image Classifier
This project is part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. The goal is to create an image classifier to identify flowers. The project consists of 2 parts:

Implementation of training and prediction in Jupyter notebook
Porting the code from Jupyter notebook to 2 separate scripts: to train a network model and to classify an image based on an existing trained network model.

<p>
The project is broken down into multiple steps:-
1.Load and preprocess the image dataset
2.Train the image classifier on your dataset
3.Use the trained classifier to predict image content
